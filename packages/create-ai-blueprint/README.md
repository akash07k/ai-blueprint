Requires Node.js 22 or newer. Run the installer from an application that has
already been scaffolded and initialized as a Git repository.

```bash
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest
```

You can also use npm's initializer form:

```bash
npm create @akash07k/ai-blueprint@latest
```

GitHub Copilot CLI is the default installer and workflow adapter. Omitted,
`--yes`, and non-interactive installs copy these files into the current directory:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `blueprint/.state/manifest.json`
- `.agents/`
- `blueprint/`

It keeps the app's root `README.md` alone and installs the Blueprint workflow
docs at `blueprint/README.md`. It does not create or manage
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

The installed workflow includes optional Render and Vercel deployment readiness
through `/release` or `$release`; it prepares local config and checks, but does
not deploy without explicit approval.

The optional `/ci` or `$ci` skill sets up automatic GitHub checks separately
from onboarding and adoption. It detects the real project commands, defines one
Verify command from checks that already exist, and adds a matching pull request
workflow without replacing existing CI. It does not invent tests or add git
hooks, coverage, browser tests, security scans, or version matrices by default.

It also includes `/rollback` or `$rollback` for planning a reviewed reversal of
a completed feature from its archived spec and exact git commit. Rollbacks keep
the original feature archive and use the normal implement, check, and complete
gates.

If you install `--claude` or `--all` while Claude Code is already open in the
project, restart Claude Code in that folder so the newly added project skills
appear.

## Tool support

| Tool | Installed adapter | Invocation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `AGENTS.md` and `.agents/skills/` | Ask naturally, for example "run the feature skill" |
| Codex | `.agents/skills/` | `$feature`, `$implement`, or plain language |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `/feature`, `/implement`, and other slash commands |
| Other tools | `AGENTS.md` plus readable skill files | Ask the agent to follow the matching `SKILL.md` |

## Options

```bash
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest -- --copilot
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest -- --codex
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest -- --claude
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest -- --all
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest -- --both
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest -- --force
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest -- --target ./my-app
```

The same flags work with `npm create @akash07k/ai-blueprint@latest -- ...`.
`--all` installs every adapter. `--both` is a warning-emitting deprecated alias
for `--all`.

The installer defaults to GitHub Copilot. `--both` remains as a deprecated alias
for `--all` and prints a warning. GitHub Copilot uses `AGENTS.md` and the shared
`.agents/skills/` files; the installer does not manage
`.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

Use `--force` to overwrite existing Blueprint files. Without `--force`, the
installer asks before overwriting in an interactive terminal and exits in
non-interactive runs.

## Updating an existing installation

Preview the update plan:

```bash
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest update --dry-run
```

Apply the update:

```bash
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest update
```

The updater reads the installed manifest as the authoritative adapter record.
Manifest-backed Codex and Claude Code installs retain exactly those adapters.
Manifest-less `.agents/skills/` installations use legacy Codex inference. The
updater manages only these paths:

- `.agents/skills/`
- `.claude/skills/`
- `blueprint/README.md`

It preserves `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, project and build plans, context, history,
references, and prototypes. The `blueprint/.state/manifest.json` file records the
installed version and hashes of managed files.

Locally modified managed files are reported as conflicts. Interactive updates
ask before replacing them. Non-interactive updates exit unless you pass
`--force`, which backs up the conflicting files before replacement. Backups are
stored under `blueprint/.state/backups/` and ignored by git.

The first update of a legacy install creates the manifest. Files that already
match the current package are adopted automatically. Differing files remain
conflicts so local changes are not lost.

## Checking project status

Run the read-only status command from a Blueprint project or any directory
inside it:

```bash
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest status
```

It reports build-plan progress, active work, findings, Git state, drift
warnings, completion blockers, and one suggested next action. For scripts and
integrations, request the versioned JSON object:

```bash
npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest status --json
```

After an interactive Blueprint install, the installer offers to run the
following optional global installation command:

```bash
npm install --global @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest
```

The prompt defaults to no and is skipped for non-interactive and `--yes` runs.
Global installation exposes the shorter forms `blueprint status` and
`blueprint status --json`. Use `--target ./my-app` to inspect an explicit
project directory. Status never edits project or Git state.

The optional global `blueprint` command is status-only. Continue to use
`npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest` for installation and
`npx @akash07k/create-ai-blueprint@latest update` for managed workflow updates.
